How exactly does the Internet work?

 - The browser then requests that webpage from a web server.
 - The web server (a back-end server) in return sends a response and takes all files requested (html, 
   css, images and js) and then back to the browser.
 - The browser only understands html, css and js.
 - The browser takes these files sent by the web server and render the webpage
   requested by the user.
 - These steps above are known as Front-End web development.
